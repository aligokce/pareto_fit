Notes
-----
* `simple_script.py` has minimal dependencies and is for referencing purposes.
* `main.py` runs multithreaded. The number of threads is defined inside the script.
* `config.json` is an example use of a config file. To be implemented. For now, higrid parameters are defined inside `utils/math.py` as constants.

Tasks
-----
[ ] Rewrite preprocessing function from `higrid` to disintegrate `tqdm` loading
